- 👋 Hi, I’m Agu!
- 👀 I’m interested in web and app development, games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript for the most part, as well as general web dev through The Odin project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on basically anything JS related, since it'll give me much needed extra experience with it :)
- 📫 You can find me on Discord - Jin#6139
